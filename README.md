# Open-Tens
The goal of this project is to develop an open-source Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) system. TENS is a therapeutic technique that involves the application of low-voltage electrical currents to the skin, primarily for pain relief. This project aims to provide a platform for individuals and healthcare professionals to build and customize their own TENS devices using readily available hardware components.

The open-source nature of this project encourages collaboration, innovation, and the sharing of knowledge among developers and users. By making the TENS system accessible to a wider audience, we hope to empower individuals to explore alternative pain management techniques and contribute to the advancement of TENS technology.

Key Features and Objectives:

    Hardware Design: The project will provide detailed documentation and schematics for designing and building a TENS device. The emphasis will be on using affordable and easily obtainable components, making it accessible to hobbyists, researchers, and healthcare professionals.

    Software Development: The project will include software libraries and interfaces to control the TENS device. The software will allow users to adjust parameters such as frequency, pulse width, and intensity, providing a customizable and user-friendly experience.

    Safety and Effectiveness: Ensuring the safety and efficacy of the TENS system is of utmost importance. The project will focus on providing guidelines, best practices, and recommendations for safe usage, including electrical safety precautions and appropriate electrode placement.

    Community and Collaboration: The project aims to foster a supportive and collaborative community of developers, researchers, and users. This will be achieved through an online forum, issue tracking system, and regular updates to encourage discussions, bug reporting, feature requests, and contributions from the community.

By creating an open-source TENS system, we hope to democratize access to this pain management technique, encourage further research and development, and improve the lives of individuals suffering from chronic pain. Join us in this journey of innovation, empowerment, and open science.

Note: This project is not intended to replace professional medical advice or treatment. Users should consult with healthcare professionals before using the TENS system for any medical conditions or concerns.
